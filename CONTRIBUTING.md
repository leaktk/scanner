## Guidelines

* Try to avoid extra libs when the feature would be small to implement
  from scratch
* Format the code with `make format`
* Use [proper names](https://gist.github.com/bplaxco/f2a5a1b29f7510b0eb94505ac1b400c3)
  for variables and functions
* Sort and group import statements in the order built-in, external lib,
  internal lib with `make import`
